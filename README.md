###### install instructions

in order to run really handy modules for soundcloud + visualization etc on the client side, we need a thing called browserify.

`npm install --global browserify`

might also have to run

`npm install soundcloud-badge`
`npm install soundcloud-resolve`
`npm install web-audio-analyser`
`npm install beats`

ill keep updating this as I go
probablllly can wrap all these installs up into a juicy command but eh
